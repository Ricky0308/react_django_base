# Logging
Several types of loggers are available, including common, security, and analytics. When creating a logger instance, choose the most appropriate type based on its purpose. You can find the available lon settings.py under LOGGING["loggers"].

An example code for logger definition is 
```
import logging
logger_security = logging.getLogger("security")
```

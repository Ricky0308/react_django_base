# Logging
## logger category
Several types of loggers are available, including common, security, and analytics. When creating a logger instance, choose the most appropriate type based on its purpose. You can find the available lon settings.py under LOGGING["loggers"].

An example code for logger definition is 
```
import logging
logger_security = logging.getLogger("security")
```

## logging format
Logs must be in JSON format with the main log text stored under the `"message"` key. To include any additional context, pass a serializable dictionary using the `extra` argument. For example:
```python
logger.info("Hello, world!", extra={"additional": "additional_value"})
```
This approach ensures that all log entries remain structured and easily parsable.

## Project Configuration
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Built with **React (v18.3.1)** and **TypeScript** using **Vite (v6.0.5)**.  
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Strict mode is enabled.  
- **UI Library**: Uses [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) style components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Avatar`), located in `frontend/src/components/ui`.  

---

## Folder Structure
- A feature-based architecture with top-level directories for:
  - `features/`  
  - `components/`  
  - `pages/`  
  - `hooks/`  

### Features
- Each folder under `frontend/src/features/` contains files for a specific functionality (e.g. `auth`, `user`).
  - For example, `features/auth/` holds `authSlice.ts` to manage user authentication state.
- API-related files reside under `features/api/`.
- API URLs are centralized at `src/config/api.ts`.

### Components
- `frontend/src/components/` contains reusable UI elements.
- Components are grouped by usage. For example, `components/settings/` holds UI elements used on the Settings page.

### Pages
- The `pages` folder contains route-specific components.

### Hooks
- The `hooks` folder contains custom React hooks that can be shared across the project.

---

## State Management
- **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management.

### Authentication State
- Managed by a Redux slice in `frontend/src/features/auth/authSlice`.
- A local storage middleware (`frontend/src/middleware/localStorageMiddleware.ts`) persists auth state.  
- Whenever a user logs in or a token refresh occurs (via `request` in `frontend/src/features/api/baseService.ts`), Redux user info is updated.
- The local storage middleware stores the updated user info to `localStorage`.

---

## API Integration
- The backend API domain is defined in `frontend/src/config/api.ts`.
- All endpoints are also centralized in `frontend/src/config/api.ts`.
- **Service Pattern**: For example, `features/api/authService` handles auth endpoints.
- All API calls must use the `request` method from `frontend/src/features/api/baseService.ts`, which handles:
  - CSRF protection
  - Automatic refresh of access tokens on expiration

---

## Routing
- Uses **React Router (v7)** for navigation.
- Routes are defined in `App.tsx`.
- Implements nested routing with a `Layout` wrapper (`frontend/src/Layout.tsx`) for consistent UI across pages.

---

## UI Components & Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** is used, with a custom configuration.
- A custom UI component library is located in `src/components/ui`.
- Components follow a consistent pattern and use TypeScript for prop definitions.
- Components are customizable via variant props.
- Uses shadcn/ui–inspired components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Avatar`).
- A custom color scheme is defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

---

## Message Localization
- All text strings are (ideally) centralized in `frontend/src/utils/messages.ts` to maintain consistency.
